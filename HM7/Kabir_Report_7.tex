\section{Problem 1: Convolutional Neural Networks}
\begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*. ]
    \item \textit{2 Convolutional Layers}
     A convolutional neural network was constructed with 32 filters in the first layer and 64 filters in the second layer. The kernel size was set to 3x3 for both layers. After 200 training epochs, the model reached a validation accuracy of \%, and validation loss curves can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:conv_loss_a}. The training took 500 seconds, however t
